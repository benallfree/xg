# X Games ðŸŽ®

A Chrome extension that enables X (Twitter) communities to embed and manage interactive games directly in their feeds.

## How It Works

1. **Create a Community**

   - Create a new community on X
   - Add `(X game)` to your community title so Xgames can identify your community as compatible.
   - Add your game URL to your community description

2. **Installation Instructions**
   Add these instructions to your community description:
   ```
   ðŸŽ® To participate in this game:
   1. Install X Games extension: [Chrome Web Store Link]
   2. Refresh this community page
   3. The game will appear in the community feed
   ```

## Features

- Automatic detection of X game-enabled communities
- Seamless iframe embedding of external games
- Game management through extension popup
- Persistent storage of game configurations
- Community-specific game associations
